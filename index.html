                    The project is designed to control a robotic vehicle using a remote. IR sensor is interfaced to the control unit on the robot for sensing the IR signals transmitted by the remote. Transmitting end uses a remote through which IR commands are transmitted. At the receiver end, these commands are used for controlling the robot in all directions such as forward, backward and left or right etc.</div> </p>

Therefore, humanoid robots need a lightweight body, high flexibility, many kinds of 
                sensors and high intelligence.Humanoid robots are professional service robots built to 
                mimic human motion and interaction.</div></p>

This game is played on a 3X3 grid board and one by one each player gets a chance to mark its respective symbol on the empty spaces of the grid. Once a player is successful in marking a strike of the same symbol either in the horizontal, vertical or diagonal way is created that player wins the game else the game goes on a draw if all the spots are filled.</div></p>

                    The idea is to create a sort of robot 
                    which going to be driven by voice commands. The robot is remotely controlled by a mobile 
                    phone; there are many articles that show the communication between a robot and smart 
                    phone. Smart phone is a very good interface for remotely automating the robot. It contains 
                    many features that can be helpful.The vehicle is to be controlled wirelessly with the use of android
                    smartphone; our intention is to make a robotic vehicle with use of advanced smartphone
                    technology in a very simple and economic way.</div></p>
